		<h2>How Life was ?</h3>
			<h3>Primary life</h3>
				<p>I generally don't remember much but I would like to share how life was and a few stories regarding it.
				Life was generally very slow, calm  with new experiences with friends time to time. It was all fine 
				My schooling was done in Sadhu Vaswani International School,Navi Mumbai till 10th std, I wanted to continue there but due to eventually decided to join a couching class in Navi Mumbai. 
				This school is one of the most affordable and up-to-the-mark infrastructure 
				with friendly, understanding, and coorparative teachers who have extracted excellent results from the students 
				which was founded by Late Shri Dada J.P. Vaswani, who was a vivid philanthropist and a disciple of Late Shri Dada T.L. Vaswani.

				<p>My Jr. College was actually a dummy school but I have to go to the school , 
				Tilak Public School Navi Mumbai, and the couching teachers used to come to school to teach  
				which is one of the most unique method since most of the couching was conducted in classes itself 
				and this program was made after keeping an eye on the students for in order to provide school like enviroment to the students.
				The school teachers were extremely friendly and undestanding. They understand the student and their behavior to the core and
				how do are extremely wise. Also the couching teachers demonstrated exceptional teaching skills 
				and also guided students towards the right path, leaving a profound and enduring impact on me.          	
				The good things that happened in that time period was my <i><b>board results</i></b></p>
