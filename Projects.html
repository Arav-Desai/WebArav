		<h1>Projects in detail for nerds</h1>
			<h2>Railway Reservation System</h2> 
			<p>This project's propose was to make a simple, 
			easy to understand, and elegent Static UI with the 
			help of HTML and CSS without use of Javascript 
			which is totally opposite to the current UI which has 
			a lot going on in every column making the whole experience 
			overwhelming and hard to understand.
			<br>
			Note: that this is just the prototype of a simple static UI and 
			cannot be used to make an actual booking page through it.
			<br>  
			<h3>Key contents of this page</h3>
			<dt>Key pages</dt> 
				<dd>Home page:This page is the parent page where all other pages 
				are connected except the payments page.</dd> 
				<dd>Register page:This page is where the account can be made
				from which you can login and book your reservation.Even though the home page
				can book your ticket without any registration since the sole purpose of this page
				was to potray the appearance and not the working of the page.</dd>
				<dd>Login page:This page where you can login to the website.</dd>
				<dd>Availibility page:This page shows the availibility of seats in a simple tabular 
				format from which you can choose journey according to your own suitability
				and based on availibity.</dd> 
				<dd>Payment page:This page replicates the real payment without actually paying.</dd> 
			<dt>Other pages</dt>
				<dd> Contact us page:This page is made as a simple version of contact us page in IRCTC Website.</dd>
				<dd> Founder's page:A page dedicated to the makers of this pagpe which my small team &#128522;</dd>
				<dd> About us page: This page is made to potray the vision of the railways towards its people.</dd> </p>

		<h2>Heart Disease Prediction System Using Python</h2>
 			<p>This python project uses simple application of naive bayes theorem due to its discrete nature without 
			the use of any library. It contains 2 Modules one for training and other for GUI and data input. 
			Since its a 2-layered architecture it makes modifing the code more efficiently. 
			Frontend: The GUI is made using Tkinter library while no library is imported for the Backend  program. </p>

		<h2>Car Price Prediction System</h2>
			<p>This python project contains 2 modules -1 is the backend and other is the frontend which isa 2-layered structure.
			Frontend:It is made using SimpleGUI library which is a combinaiton of many GUI libraries and contains simple functions 
			for inputs of multiple variables one at a time.
			Backend: It is made from Random ForestRegression which is imported from scikit-learn library. This model was choosen after 
			comparing virtually and numerically with the test results to different other regression models i.e., 
			 Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression, XGB Regression.</p>

		<h2>Addition of 2 variable System</h2>
			<p>This project is just a simple addition between 2 numbers project that shows the results of the 2 numbers which sounds
			simple but here's the catch that instead of using simple circuit addition we will use data set to operate and teach addition 
			through linear regression model imported from scikit learn which is sounds like the model will be will always be accuracte
			and would not need any testing of anything but we will notice that larger the number becomes the more inaccurate it will be
			. Eg:- <img src=".\add_2_num_using_ML.png" alt="preview">
			<br>
			This project was made in order to study the Linear Regression model with no intent to get accurate answers.
			 This project is also divided into frontend and backend module where frontend is made using Tkinter while backend imports 
			scikit learn. </p>

		<h2> Math Function System</h2>
			<p>This Project is made to study the accuracy of multiple regression models upon a non-linear mathematical function
			f(x)= log<sub>10</sub>(a)+3*b+c<sup>5</sup>+sin(d) to observe their test results and study the properties of 
			each model and why. This project doesn't contains any GUI since no new data is being added, the prewritten data set is 
			studied in this project.
			We observe that through this project the RandomForest seems to be most accurate with the accuracy of 99.99999999%
			while linear regression with only 72% accuracy and Gradient Boosting with 99.99999% accuracy.
			Here's a simple demonstration below:- <br> <img src=".\rf_r_graph.png" alt="preview"> <figcaption>visual represntation of random forest regression model with test results</figcaption> 
			<br> <img src=".\linear_r_graph.png" alt="preview"> <figcaption>visual represntation of linear regression model with test results</figcaption>  </p>  
			<p>We can see from the above 2 graphs the behavior of linear regression while other regressions have a straight line.</p>
