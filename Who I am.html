			<dd>Overthinking made Every day, my make hundreds of tiny decisions that shape my overall wellbeing and mood, like choosing what to eat, which tasks to prioritize, or how my spend my leisure time even though it doesn't results in anything except for me overthinking more and this habit of overthinking makes a tendency to overthink certain decisions or become a drunk philosopher.In short, a vivid daydreamer who's an ambivert and a little above average.</dd>  

			<dd>Desire for Self-Improvement is always something I wanted to do but unfortunatly landing the same place where I was. &#128532;</dd>

			<dd>While I am mostly open minded for almost all the things (means I don't care much) except for  few things which I am intolerent to which I will obviously not gonna announce here (or the society will not accept me).</dd>

			<dd>I generally ask the <i><b>why</b></i> of everything (not bcz I like it but bcz I think it's necessary) then the <I><b>how</b></i>, thus leading to a very logical and analytical approach with a nice observation, I believe could lead to solutions to almost all problems even life's problems a.k.a. traps.</dd>

			<dd>I might value spontaneity but also crave stability, and I am confident in some areas but uncertain in others.</dd>.
